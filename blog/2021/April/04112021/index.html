            <p>Hey person hey,<br><br>
                Okay, to start off, I still have done no coding. But I did open the Python Crash Course book. Did I
                only read one chapter? Yes, but at least I did something. I'm going to read more of the book this week
                as well as doing the example work. My goal for the upcoming week will be 5 chapters. I'll make the
                following week's goal after seeing how the week goes.<br><br>
                I do have other updates. I'm interviewing with three companies. The first is for a tradition business
                analyst role which I know I'd be very good at, but I never really enjoyed being a BA. The second is for
                a Associate Manager (not actually managing people) in a software department of a media company. This is
                the one that is most like my old job, and I absolutely loved my old job. I know that this is something
                that I could really enjoy and the team is hoping to make the move to 100% remote which is nice. The
                third is a Junior Data Analyst role in a 100% remote team. This is the exact role I had spent months
                hoping for and eventually giving up on. Hopefully in two weeks time, I'll tell you that I have a job!
                But then again, I said that on March 15 as well and that didn't amount to anything. I honestly thought
                I'd have a job by now but I'm still enjoying the time off.<br><br>
                My languages are coming along nicely. Japanese is becoming a little easier. My sentences are becoming a
                bit more advanced (as in I might be an advanced beginner now) and I've started learning Kanji which
                makes me feel so cool. Italian is nice as well. I'm getting better with my grammar so I can better
                express myself which is great. I want to find a way to add to my Italian vocabulary. I use Anki for my
                Japanese so I'm going to try to find a pre-made deck for Italian.<br><br>
                The weather has been really wonderful recently so I've spent many afternoons lounging on our porch
                instead of doing anything productive and then somehow it's late and time to workout and I don't get
                much done that day. I'm going to try either do work while I lounge or spend less time outside. I have
                started running again with the hope that I can eventually join a lacrosse team if/when I move to New
                York City. To be honest, I dislike running a lot but I dislike not being able to keep up during a
                lacrosse practice or game more so the running shall continue. I'll aim for 5 miles a week over three
                days but I'll probably just do Just Dance instead.<br><br>
                I know it might not seem like a lot but I am enjoying my life. I miss being in London and can't wait
                till I can move to NYC, but until then life seems to be progressing nicely and I can't complain.<br><br>
                Till next time,<br>
                Cope.
