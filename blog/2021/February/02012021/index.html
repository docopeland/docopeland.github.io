            <p>Hi lovely,<br><br>
                I'm a day late, but thankfully, not a dollar short. I know, I'm not funny.I wanted to be able to say
                that I had finished my coursera python specialization and I thought that if I gave myself an extra day
                that I would be able to do it. But alas, I haven't finished. I plan on finishing it today but we'll see
                how that goes.<br><br>
                This last class has been kicking my butt in the best way possible. The other courses were about learning
                python and had weekly assignments and a final project. I was able to do all of that work with a bit of
                effort. This course is nothing like that. We explore third-party libraries that are useful in python
                programming. In case you don't know, a library has different functions and methods that you can use in
                your programming. You only import a library when you need it. It's like having lots of things in storage
                and only grabbing the Christmas decorations when you want to put them up. Third-party libraries are kind
                of like buying a giant sewing kit to add to your storage so you can access them when  you want.<br><br>
                The third-party libraries that we are exploring are useful for image manipulation. I started this course
                thinking that it was so stupid. Image manipulation isn't something that I need to know. I need to work
                on my programming, not a specialized part of python programming. But after the first graded assignment,
                I'm glad that I'm doing the course. It made me realize how the previous four courses had really held my
                hand. The previous assignments had essentially been planned out for me. Do this, then do this, then put
                it all together. This one, I get shown how to swim then thrown into the deep end. Crazily enough, I
                swam well.<br><br>
                Like I said earlier, I'm hoping to finish this course today or tomorrow and then I'll be done with
                coursera for awhile. What next for me? I was gifted the Python Crash Course book and bought Automate The
                Boring Stuff With Python. I plan on working through those books as I navigate my life in New York.<br><br>
                New York? Yup, I'm back in New York. Living at my mom's house, hence the title of the blog. Bonus points
                to anyone who knows this song. My music taste is all over the place so don't judge me once you've
                googled it, okay? I arrived on Thursday, 28 January and am slowly adjusting. I've already unpacked two
                suitcases (go me!), need to buy hangers before I can unpack the other two. I've made a list for the
                things I need to buy (a girl can only fit so much into four suitcases), started decorating my room, and
                enjoying my time with my family. One thing I'm not enjoying, all of the snow. Of course when I come home
                there's a huge snow storm. I'm not looking forward to having to shovel again. But soon I'll get back in
                the swing of things, even though I'll miss London immensely.<br><br>
                Okay, quick update about everything else. Made a hangman game with python. Made spinach tortillas.
                Started my Japanese language studies. Progressing well with Italian. Just about died from an epic
                shoulders workout. Spend way too much time with my dog. Thinking about getting an Apple watch.<br><br>
                Till next time,<br>
                Cope.
