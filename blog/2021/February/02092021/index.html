            <p>Hey person hey,<br><br>
                I am so late and I am sorry. Thank you for being patient with me. The past few days have been a bit crazy.
                On Sunday, I had a video chat with a friend, a video dance HIIT workout with my (old) cheer team, taught
                a two-hour tutoring session, watched the Super Bowl, and had a late birthday celebration with my family.
                On Monday, I drove 45 minutes to drop off my mom's friend (who lives with us) at a train station so that
                she could go into New York City. Did I mention that this was at 6:45 in the morning? Then went to Target
                to buy some stuff that I needed, cooked until she was ready for me to pick her up, picked her up, went
                to an electronics store, later went to buy missing groceries. Today I shoveled snow before heading back
                to the grocery store. So yeah, a bit crazy but should hopefully calm down now.<br><br>
                Even though I felt like a chicken with it's head cut off, I always made time to get some coding in. I
                mostly did Exercism exercises as they can be quick and fun to do. Sometimes they're difficult (even
                though I'm doing the easy ones) but that's because I don't know all the libraries or need to sit and think
                in a more developer kind of way. I do enjoy the struggles though. I finished that super hard course that
                unsurprisingly had a crazy hard final project so now I have two coursera specializations in python under
                my belt. I think I will start the first python book sometime this week, but definitely not today. Going
                to start applying for jobs today so wish me luck. <br><br>
                Quick update about everything else: I've been here less than two weeks and its snow 4 days already. I
                bought an Apple Watch SE and I love it. Re-buying stuff I had in London is expense. The cake my mom got
                me was a cookie ice cake which was absolutely amazing. The Super Bowl was terrible. My dog is still
                clingy. Can't wait to play my new Nintendo Switch games.<br><br>
                Till next time,<br>
                Cope.
