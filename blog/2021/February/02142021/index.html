            <p>Hey person hey,<br><br>
                First things first, I love you. However, you are, I love you. And you should love yourself too.<br><br>
                Happy Valentine's Day, Galentine's Day, a belated Lunar New Year, and my dog's fifth birthday. This is
                such a wonderful weekend. I celebrated my painting my nails and taking my dog for a long walk. My sister
                bought me a super wonderful Mickey Mouse card and my mom gave me a beautiful flower. I plan on taking a
                bath and doing a face mask after I finish writing this blog. I hope you've done or will do something nice
                for yourself. The most important relationship you'll ever have is with yourself, so treat yo self.<br><br>
                Okay, coding time. I removed the header from my website. Why? Because it wasn't working well. It was
                becoming such a hassle so I removed it from all of the pages. For right now, it will remain gone. One
                day, I'll go back and fix it. I also need to fix the blog page for mobile devices. The blog cards are
                not showing up correctly and they need to work in order for people to use mobile devices correctly.<br><br>
                Python-wise, I started reading one of my Python books, Python Crash Course. It starts off with stuff I
                already know but will move into projects later. I'm hoping to read the book quickly and get to the
                projects soon. I'm still practicing Exercisms on a daily basis but maybe I shouldn't wait till 11:45pm
                to start the exercises.<br><br>
                On the job front, I am searching for Business Analyst and Data Analyst jobs. The Data Analyst job would
                require me to do statistical analysis with R, Python, or Excel. At first I was thinking that I wouldn't
                be able to be a data analyst due to lack of experience but then I realized that I do have experience. I
                just need to leverage the experience I have. I used R during my undergrad courses and during my masters'
                dissertation. While I'm not an expert in Python (yet), I can do basic analysis and I can use Python with
                SQL relational databases. I once worked as an intern where I did some data analysis using Excel and at
                another job I created a macro with VBA (Excel). I will continue searching for junior data analysis jobs
                and will not let my insecurities get in my way.<br><br>
                So yeah, that's what going on with my life. Now that I'm done with this post, I'm off to pamper myself.<br><br>
                Till next time,<br>
                Cope.
