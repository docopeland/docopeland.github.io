            <p>Hi hi hi,<br><br>
                So today, I'm going to be super honest. I have no clue what the heck I'm doing. I'm very much winging
                everything. I have a plan-ish but everything is still in the air. Crazily enough, that doesn't scare me.
                If I was anything like a normal person, that would be scary but for me it's exciting. It's exciting not
                knowing what I'm going to do next or where I'll live next.
                <br><br>
                Throwing everything to the wind is not for everyone. I am privileged enough to have a good support system
                to fall onto in case everything goes badly. I also have enough savings where I can be a bit crazy. Even
                if you are privileged as me, it still might not be for you. It requires A LOT of confidence in yourself.
                <br><br>
                I am unemployed during a global pandemic that has left most economies shattered. However, I am confident
                that I will find a job. Why? I apply to job postings in the field that I want to be in and I am confident
                in my professional abilities. I've worked for three years in roles where I've had to push myself
                professionally and have succeeded in every situation. One day, I will become a python developer. How do
                I know this? I am confident in my process of learning and practicing my skills. Except for yesterday, I
                have worked on my coding every single day this year. In two or three years from now, I will be living
                abroad again. I am confident in my language studies. I'm taking classes that help me to understand
                Italian grammar and practice my conversation skills. I am working through my Japanese book at a
                consistent pace and will get the next book in the series once I am done. I will get a handstand this
                year because I am confident in the training sessions that I do on my own and with my personal trainer.
                <br><br>
                Are you getting why I'm so confident? I am confident because I am putting in the work to make sure my
                dreams come true. So I don't mind if my plans are not super duper formed and that I don't know what next
                month will bring because I'm confident that I can use next month to get to my next goal. So while I don't
                know how, where, or when, these things will happen, I do know that they will.
                <br><br>
                But the hardest part of being confident is that I'm not always 100% confident. Sometimes I'm terrified I
                won't find a job or that I'll never travel again. When those moments come, I take a breath and try to
                remind myself of all my wonderful dreams that did come true.
                <br><br>
                But seriously though, my handstands are actually getting so much better. Apparently doing all the things
                that my trainer told me to do really does help. <br><br>
                Till next time,<br>
                Cope.
