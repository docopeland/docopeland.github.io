            <p>Hey person hey,<br><br>
                So today is the last day of the second month of the year. We're one-sixth of the way done with the year.
                It doesn't seem like it's been that it's been that long but it really has. I think this is normally when
                people start to break their resolutions. But I can happily say that I've been working super hard on my
                resolutions. I'm not finished all of them, it would be impossible for some of them. So yeah, get ready
                to get info on my resolutions (aka I couldn't think of anything better to write today :p )<br><br>
                Get stronger. I've gotten so much stronger already this year. I was using 5kg weights in London but now
                I'm using 10lbs which is lighter than 5kg. How does this make me stronger? Well, I can focus on my form
                and do more reps. Plus, my trainer says so, so boooo.<br><br>
                Do a controlled handstand. Nope. I can do an uncontrolled one though. And I can do one against the wall.
                It's a work in progress but there is progress.<br><br>
                #100DaysOfCode. I have coded all but one day this year. There hasn't been 100 days of the year yet so
                I can't finish this for another month or so.<br><br>
                <del>Get this website up and running.</del> Done. Done. Done. If you haven't realized it, go look around
                the website.<br><br>
                Italian back to B2. I've finished week 8 of my Italian A2 class. Only 8 more weeks. Then 16 weeks of B1
                and 16 weeks of B2. Then I'll have finished this one. The grammar is killing me. Did you know there are
                21 tenses in Italian? TWENTY-ONE! I know 6.<br><br>
                Japanese to N5. N5 is the lowest, the highest is N1. I'm not sure if I'll get to N5 by the end of the
                year. Japanese is hard. Interesting, but hard. I'll keep working hard at it and eventually get there.<br><br>
                I'm really proud of my progress this year. Every single year, I've made resolutions, and every single
                year, I've given up on them. They are always too big and I don't make reasonable steps to achieve them.
                This year, I'm really focusing on making reasonable goals that I can make into smaller steps. I think
                I'll achieve them this year but we'll see in 10 months. But yeah, I couldn't figure out anything more
                interesting to write about today. Hopefully next week I'll be more interesting. <br><br>
                Till next time,<br>
                Cope.
