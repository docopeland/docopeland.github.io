          <p>
            I am so excited to be writing my first blog post. The website is no where near close to being finished but I wanted to write a blog post no matter 
            what.<br><br>
            Today is the first day of 2021. Instead of focusing on the dumpster fire that was 2020 I am focusing on working on my development skills in 2021.
            <br><br>
            But before I can focus on what <bold>HAS</bold> to be a better year, I want to let you know about my biggest set back of 2020, losing my job.<br><br>
            I loved my job. My coworkers felt like a weird silly family and my work fulfilled me. It was the best job I had ever had and losing it hurt a lot. 
            But losing it has pushed me to acknowledge that I was not focusing on my development skills. The developers used scala so I took a specialization in 
            Java over the summer and then started a specialization in Scala. I never finished Scala, nor do I plan to. I am now working on Python. Why the jump? 
            I could not find any junior scala jobs. Most scala developers have been working for many years in java or other object-oriented languagues before 
            switching to scala. Python, in constract, has loads of junior jobs that I can find.<br><br>
            So now that I have no job, I am moving back home. It is not an easy move. I live in London, England. My mom lives in New York State. 
            When I get back to New York, I will try to find a remote job as a IT business analyst or an automated tester while spending my free time programming.
            My goal is to become a python programmer and get a job in Milan, Italy by 2022 or 2023. This blog will document my journey towards my goal.<br><br>
            Now, before I finish up, no New Year's post is complete without stating this year's resolutions. I'm putting them here for accountability and once a 
            month, I will check back in to see if I have gotten closer to accomplishing them.
            <br><br>
            <b>New Year's Resolutions</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Get stronger</li>
            <li>Do a controlled handstand</li>
            <li>Do #100DaysOfCode</li>
            <li>Get this website up and running</li>
            <li>Get my Italian back to B2</li>
            <li>Get my Japanese to N5</li>
          </ul>
          Hopefully next time you see my blog, it will look a lot better than this :p<br><br>
          Till next time,<br>Cope</p>
