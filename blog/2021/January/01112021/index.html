          <p>OMG. Have you taken a look around the site yet. I know I'm a bit biased but I think it looks amazing. I honestly cannot believe that I've
          made such a wonderful site. Before I get any questions, yes, I 100% made this site. It was all coded by me in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
          I have it set up so that the site should look good on both cell phones and laptops. Now I can say with certainty, front-end is not for me. <br><br>
          I meant to write this post yesterday but I really wanted to get my contact and subscribing things up and running. It was a bit weird but 
          I'm happy with where they are now. So please subscribe, I'll send you a little email every time I write a blog.<br><br>
          So what's new? I've been coding every single day which I truly enjoy. I've been using Exercism and this website as my coding practice.
          It's a bit crazy for me to solve the Exercism problems knowing that a few weeks ago, I could not have done them. I really feel like all of this
          practicing will help me get better at my programming. I also did a little bit of coding on Coursera. To be honest, I never really finished my Python
          course. I wanted to get the honors certificate but I think I will just take the quiz to finish the course and start on the next course. If I decide
          to come back to do the honors I can always do so. Now to figure out which Python course to take next on Coursera. Hm...<br><br>
          Non-coding wise life is a bit meh. I bought one-way tickets to New York today which makes me sad. I can't believe in less than 17 days, my English
          adventure will be over. I've been going on daily walks in the afternoon. I hope I can walk and see all of the major sites before I go. I had to take 
          a few days off exercising because I sprained my thumb getting out of bed. Sad, I know. My Italian classes started last week and are going well. 
          My Japanese work is currently going over Hiragana and Katakana since my Japanese From Zero book arrived after I had gotten on the plane here.<br><br>
          That's it really. I don't really do much as there isn't much I can do since London is in lockdown. Don't forget to subscribe (feel like a YouTuber now)
          either on the home page or the contact page. And let me know if you see any issues on the page (not including the fact that the footer isn't 
            on the bottom of this page, I already know that).<br><br>
          Till next time,<br>
          Cope.
