          <p>It’s Sunday, which means blog time.<br>
          Thank you to everyone who has subscribed, it means a lot to me. I’d still write this blog even no one was reading but it’s so cool that people are 
          reading it. <br>
          This week I started the Sweat App Challenge, it’s a six-week challenge with new workouts. (I promise this relates to my programming). I decided to 
          do a different workout program than I normally do but after a few weeks off exercising, I needed to do the Starting Out level. At first I felt 
          thought, this will be super easy, I’ll just get back into things and switch to the harder Challenge Me level. I did my first workout and I nearly 
          cried. It was so hard. They were simple basic exercises but they definitely felt challenging. After my first week of Starting Out, I’m glad that I’m 
          doing it.<br>
          So what does this have to do with coding? Well, it’s simple. Choosing the Starting Out made me think that maybe I should do another beginner Python 
          specialisation on Coursera. I’ve been doing a lot of programming with Exercism, working on different little challenges, but I wanted to make sure 
          I really had my basics down. A lot of the information in the course is stuff I already know, but every now and then I learn something, not only new, 
          but also extremely important. I learned about aliases where essentially you have two different variables but they’re both pointing to the same 
          object and if you change one variable, you end up changing the object so both variables are changed. That is important to know and I wouldn’t have 
          known it if I didn’t do this course. Don’t get me wrong, the videos are mildly mind numbing but the extra practice and the new knowledge do make it 
          worth it.<br>
          I started the specialisation on Tuesday and I’m already done with one course. Hopefully by the time I write another post, I will have finished 
          another course or two. I’m buying some books to continue my programming once my Coursera subscription is up in February (I think). My old company 
          paid for the year’s subscription and I’m glad that they did, it's been a great starting point for me. With the books, I will hopefully be able to 
          complete some small projects to add to my GitHub to showcase my skills. Despite everything, this year is turning out to be pretty okay so far. 
          I can’t wait to see my growth for the rest of the year. <br><br>
          Till next time,<br>
          Cope.
