            <p>Hi peeps,<br><br>
                I'm playing 'Taking A Break' from Hamilton while I write this. Silly, I know. Today is the 24th of January.
                Do you know that that means? In a few days I'll be leaving London. Although I made this decision and I
                stand by my decision, I was still forced into making a decision. It's not a decision I would have made if I
                had not been made redundant. I do love London and my heart breaks a little to leave here. I've lived in
                the United Kingdom for more than four years and packing up everything to move back to New York is hard.
                I know I've talked about this so much but it's not something I can stop thinking about. <br><br>
                The other day I was so overwhelmed with everything going on (unemployment during a pandemic, moving
                countries, worrying about loads of other things) and I kind of shut down. I took a day off from everything.
                I did not workout, practice my Italian, practice my Japanese, go for a walk. None of the things that I
                normally enjoy, I just watched anime all day. It was great, I just relaxed and enjoyed the stories. I
                laughed and rolled my eyes, I completely let myself be taken in by the show. I did do a little bit of
                coding but not a lot.<br><br>
                Normally, I would feel bad about taking time off but I needed it. I needed to relax for a day. I was able
                recollect my thoughts and deal with my feelings and now I'm back on track. Not on packing track though.
                Tomorrow I will to finish my packing and will schedule for my covid test to be picked up on Tuesday.<br><br>
                In regards to coding, I've finished two more courses this week. I have two more courses to finish this
                specialization. I plan on finishing them this week. After this specialization, I'll try to start another
                specialization. There's two I like from the University of Michigan (the creators of the two python
                specializations I took): Statistics with Python and Applied Data Science with Python. I think that when I
                start looking for jobs, I'm going to look for ones that will allow me to use python on a weekly (hopefully
                daily) basis. That's why I'm going very hard right now. If I can get a job that uses python, I'll slow
                down a bit, if not, I'll keep working hard to get a job that does use python. I did get to go on a walk
                with my friend yesterday who pushed me to look for jobs that I think I'm unqualified for. What's the
                worst that'll happen? They say no. The pros are too high for me to not try.<br><br>
                Next time I write a post, I should hopefully be at my mom's house in New York.<br><br>
                Till next time,<br>
                Cope.
