            <p>Hey person hey,<br><br>
                Omg, I'm updating on a Sunday. This calls for a celebration. Things have been very crazy for the past
                few weeks. Two Saturdays ago, I spent the entire day in New York City. I went rock climbing with my
                friend that I met a few years ago in an airport. It was honestly one of the best layovers I've ever had
                cause my friend is awesome. My arms were beyond dead for the next few days. I didn't know my arms or my
                lats could hurt so bad. Last Saturday, I went apartment hunting. I looked at about 15-20 apartments
                and climbed over 30 floors. Trust me, my legs wish I was lying. Friday, I walked for hours around the
                city with a friend. It was a lot of fun even though my legs were once again killing me. I also checked
                out some apartments on Friday and Saturday. So yeah, I spent three weekends exercising and I loved it.<br><br>
                So as I mentioned, I've been doing a bit of apartment hunting. I plan on moving to New York City in a
                few weeks. I'm attempting to have my move-in date be July 1 but we'll see. It'll be my first time living
                on my own. I'm both excited and nervous. I honestly can't wait until I can start designing and
                decorating my own place.<br><br>
                What else have I been up to? Well I've been taking a Google data analyst course on Coursera. I actually
                really like the course so far. I'm spending the next year upping my skills as much as possible. I'm
                going to do projects to make sure that I am sure that I do really enjoy data analysis. If anything, at
                least I'm enjoying learning.<br><br>
                I've had to re-do a few chapters of Japanese. I just didn't remember enough to continue on. I really
                want to make sure I'm understanding everything before moving onto the next chapter. Even if it takes
                me all year, I'll get to N5 and I'll be super proud of that. Italian is a lot easier since I'm mostly
                doing grammar and not learning new vocabulary. It's great to tests on it but I need to read more
                intermediate books to get a better understanding of it. I'm not sure if I want to take the B2 course
                when I finish B1. I think I'll just focus on working on perfecting B1 before starting B2 in the next
                year. Especially since I want to be doing more data analysis projects.<br><br>
                I haven't been coding. That's cause I'm focusing on the course. But this course uses R (a statistical
                programming language) in order for analysis so I'll get my coding through that. I used to code in R
                back at Cornell and I used it for my masters dissertation. I'm actually quite good at R.
                Till next time,<br>
                Cope.
