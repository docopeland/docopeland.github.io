            <p>Hey person hey,<br><br>
                Did you miss me? I was going to write a post last week when I realized something very important. I had
                absolutely nothing to say. I mean absolutely nothing. So instead of coming up with something super
                random, I decided to make my posts bi-weekly. So I'll be sending these out every other week, unless
                something super interesting happens.<br><br>
                I'm not even going to pretend that I wrote this post on a Sunday. I went to write a new post in IntelliJ
                (the program that I use to edit my website) and it wouldn't let. So now I have to download and update
                things for it to work again. I guess it's because I updated my MacOs. What else is new in my life? Well,
                I had two interviews this week. One interview was for a business analyst type role and the other was for
                a marketing data analysis role. Personally, I think they both went really well, both recruiters seemed
                to be interested in my experiences and skills, but only time will tell. Hopefully the next posts will be
                me announcing that I have a job, but until then, I will continue applying to more jobs.<br><br>
                Also, my Japanese is coming along super well. I got a new book that arrived on Thursday. I've done the
                pre-lesson and lesson 1. I have so many Japanese words in my head and can say simple sentences now. <br><br>
                だんです。二十八歳です。今はごぜん一時です。- I am Dan. I am 28 years old. It's 1 am. I can also say what year
                of college I am in and what my major is. But since I'm not in college, it's a little less useful. To be
                honest, I don't know kanji yet, but when I write the words in Hiragana (kinda like the Japanese
                alphabet), the computer immediately picks the kanji it thinks I'm talking about.<br><br>
                Programming wise, I'm still going strong on my Exercisms. I haven't really opened up my Python books
                since I last mentioned them. Maybe, I'll get back to them soon, maybe I'll wait awhile. We'll see.<br><br>
                Finally, this week was very weird weather wise. It was super hot most of the week, then got super cold.
                Today it hailed for ten to fifteen minutes then it got super sunny. Very strange day. But enough of my
                rambling on a Sunday night/Monday morning. I hope you have a wonderful two weeks.<br><br>
                Till next time,<br>
                Cope.
