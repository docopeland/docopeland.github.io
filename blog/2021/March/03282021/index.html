            <p>Hey person hey,<br><br>
                I spent the last two weeks doing absolutely no coding. I'm writing a coding blog and I haven't coded in
                two weeks. Between Italian, Japanese, looking for a jobs, and a bunch of other random stuff that I do,
                I wasn't putting aside any real time for practicing my coding. I was spending a max of fifteen minutes
                everyday barely getting anything done. So what did I do? I decided to take some time off.<br><br>
                Actually that's a lie. I forgot to code once and then realized that it was probably best if I took some
                time to recollect. I contemplated doing an online part-time degree in computer science, doing one of
                those 12-week intensive programming course, teaching myself using free resources, and even giving up.<br><br>
                I spoke to my friends, did research, meditated. In the end, I've decided to actually carve out time
                everyday to work through my Python books. I have two books, I should be using them, right? So I'm
                promising myself to do at least 30 minutes of my books, starting tomorrow, and that it cannot be too
                late at night. I have to schedule it in just like I do every important thing in my day.<br><br>
                Other than that, I'm still unemployed. I'm still looking for jobs, still doing interviews and stuff.
                The weather is nice so I don't mind my unemployment too much. I'm learning how to relax and not to
                overwork myself so I know this time is super important.<br><br>
                That's it for me. I know it wasn't the most interesting of posts but it's the truth. Again, I hope that
                I have more interesting news to tell you in my next post, but please don't hold me to it.
                Till next time,<br>
                Cope.
