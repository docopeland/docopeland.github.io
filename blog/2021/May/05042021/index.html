            <p>Hey person hey,<br><br>
                You may have noticed that there was a much longer break between my last post on April 11 and today.
                I did that for a few reasons. The first reason was that nothing of note had happened but I knew that
                some interesting things were coming up so I wanted to wait for them. Now that those interesting things
                have happened, I'm so excited to tell you about them.<br><Br>
                Firstly, what we're all here for, I did some programming. WOOOO! I tried to continue the book but it
                was just soooo boring. If I didn't know anything about Python, it would have been super interesting but
                since I have some knowledge under my belt, it was boring. So I did what I needed to do, I skipped all
                the way to the projects sections. I'm working on my first project now, an alien invasion video game.
                Essentially, I'm building a game where aliens invade and it's up to a little space ship to keep the
                planet safe. Does it sound like an old school game you have already heard about? That's because it is.
                I'm enjoying it but I did get a little pre-occupied with some other stuff.<br><Br>
                Exercise, wise? I'm on week three of Insanity Max 30 and honestly, they named it very well. It's
                absolutely crazy but it only takes 30 minutes. It's tiring but I do feel significantly better about my
                cardio already and I still have more than a month of the program to go.<br><br>
                I finished my Italian A2 course and B1 starts on Monday. Japanese is awkwardly paused.<br><br>
                But the real reason for the wait was that I got a job! In the past three weeks, I've gotten three job
                offers. The Business Analyst role, I turned down. Then it was down to two that I was interested in. I
                ended up not taking the Junior Data Analyst role which is absolutely nuts, right? I'm not 100% sure that
                I made the right decision but I made a decision and now I need to stick with it. After four months of
                being unemployed, I am once again working.<br><br>
                Having a job is hard when you've been out of the game so I'm allowing myself time to relax. I hope that
                it doesn't get in the way of all of the other things that I'm doing so I will try to make a plan and
                stick with it. I hope you enjoyed the update and hopefully next time I'll be done with the game and
                maybe you can see it.<br><br>
                Till next time,<br>
                Cope.
