            <p>Hey person hey,<br><br>
                My mom asked me if I was doing blogs anymore so obviously I had to write a post and send it out
                immediately. Here's a new blog to let you know what I've been up to. You read?<br><br>
                Last update I told you about the project that I was working on: alien invasion. Well I took a break
                from alien invasion for a fun coding reason. I participated in a coding challenge on this website called
                CodinGame. The challenge was really hard. The idea of the challenge is to build a bot who plays a game
                for you. The game is a bit complex and has different leagues. In the first league all you have to do is
                harvest trees. It's not too hard, you just loop through the different trees and harvest them if you have
                enough suns and you get points for every harvest. I had to use the community starter code but I made it
                to the second league. <br><br>
                In this league, you have to grow trees from size 1 to size 3. Once the tree is of size 3, you can
                harvest it. It costs suns to grow your trees and to harvest them. This stage lasts for more than one day
                in the game and you earn more suns based on how the size of the trees and based on where they are
                planted. This is the league that I got stuck on but I'm still super proud of myself for making it to the
                second league, which was my goal. My goal for the next challenge (which probably won't happen for awhile
                since it was a Spring Challenge) is to get to second league without having to use the starter code. Now
                that the challenge is over I'm going to go back to my alien invasion.<br><br>
                Other updates, I'm in week three of my new job. It's still too soon to know if I like it or not. A part
                of me (the FOMO part) wonders what it'd be like if I had taken the junior data analyst role but I will
                never know. I'm making the most of this job and working hard. I did get to work on my Excel skills which
                was super nice. I'm trying to keep my data analyst skills up. I'm thinking about taking some online
                courses and/or doing some volunteering analysis work. Hopefully it works out.<br><br>
                Everyday feels like a weekend when you're exhausted from my new month of Insanity Max 30. I'm tired but
                I'm loving the fact that things that made me out of breathe are no longer an issue. I take my dog on a
                walk down and up a hill for fun and we do it so easily.<br><br>
                I'm loving life and hope you are too.
                Till next time,<br>
                Cope.
