    <h1><center><b>Welcome to my site!</h1></center></b>
    <p>My name is Danielle and I am an aspiring python developer.<br><br>
      As a beginner programmer, there are many things that I have not learned or done yet. I plan on changing that in 2021. Through Coursera courses,
      FreecodingCamp, and Exercism, I plan on "leveling up". This website will focus on my learning and projects, mixed with a bit of my life.<br><br>
      While my end goal is to become a professional programmer, I want to enjoy the journey, <i>one line of code at a time.</i>
