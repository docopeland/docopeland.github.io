    <h2>Danielle Copeland</h2>
    <h3>Aspiring Python Developer</h3>
    <p>My name is Danielle and I am an aspiring Python developer. 
      I've dabbled with Java and Scala and am currently learning Python. 
      This page and blog will focus on my learning and projects, mixed with a bit of my life. 
      Thank you for joining me on my journey.<br>
      As a beginner programmer, there are many things that I haven't learned or done yet. 
      However, I plan on using 2021 to change that. 
      Through Coursera courses, Freecodingcamp, and Exercism, I plan on "leveling up". 
      While my end goal is to become a professional programmer, I want to enjoy the journey, one line of code at a time.
